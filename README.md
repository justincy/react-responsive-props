# Responsive Props in React

This repo contains a simple Next.js app which demonstrates different responsive prop patterns. Each page is dedicated to one pattern and shows different ways to implement a Button component following the given pattern. 

* [Conditional Rendering](/pages/conditional)
* [Breakpoint Props](/pages/breakpoint)
* [Object of Props](/pages/object)
* [Array of Props](/pages/array)

This repo was created in conjunction with a blog post about responsive props.
